<p><span class="dropcap">T</span>hree weeks before Donald Trump officially accepted the Republican nomination last year, the Trump Organization renewed licenses on thousands of new domain names for business ventures at home and around the world—including<a href="http://www.celebrityapprenticepoker.com/"> </a><a href="http://www.celebrityapprenticepoker.com/">CelebrityApprenticePoker.com</a>, <a href="http://www.trumpforeclosureinvesting.com/">TrumpForeclosureInvesting.com</a> and <a href="http://www.trumptowermoscow.com/">TrumpTowerMoscow.com</a>.</p>
<p>The re-registration of domain names continued after Trump’s inauguration, with hundreds of sites kept for potential new businesses in Ireland, the United Arab Emirates, China, India and Indonesia once he was already in the Oval Office. Three weeks before Trump hosted Chinese President Xi Jinping at his Mar-a-Lago club in south Florida, the Trump Organization renewed its licenses for MarALagoClubAsia.com and theMarALagoClubAsia.</p>
<p>There’s also TrumpOnIce.com and TrumpDrone.com.</p>

<p>Publicly available internet directory records analyzed by POLITICO from the domain registration database website WhoIs.com show thousands of sites registered by the Trump Organization’s general counsel, with many for existing Trump businesses, including some that have since been shuttered, but many that instead direct to holding pages.</p>
<p>They appear to provide a roadmap for ventures the president’s company has been considering, though some are in places that are now trouble spots for his presidency: TrumpRussia.com and TrumpUkraine.com were both renewed on June 29, 2016, while DonaldJTrumpSignatureCollectionVenezuela.com, TrumpApparelVenezuela.com, TrumpClothingVenezuela.com, TrumpHomeBathVenezuela.com, TrumpBeddingVenezuela.com and TrumpHomeAccessoriesVenezuela.com were updated on Oct. 14, 2016.</p>

<div id="trump-u"></div>
<p>Trump has always been ambitious to expand, and his interest in building a Trump Tower in Moscow dates back at least as far as a visit to the Russian capital in 1996, during which he said he’d like to build a replica of his signature 5th Avenue skyscraper there. While TrumpTowerMoscow.com was renewed as recently as June 29, 2016, there do not appear to be any short-term plans to move forward on such a project, especially given that Trump is facing multiple investigations into whether his campaign colluded with the Kremlin ahead of the election.</p>
<p>Eric Goldman, a professor at the Santa Clara Law School and director of its High Tech Law Institute who’s written about corporate use of domain registration, said that the Trump Organization’s activity could represent “very long-range planning or pre-emptive registration.”</p>
<p>Goldman said most companies tend to use holding companies or individuals for this kind of activity, which would be harder to track. Given the relatively minimal costs of buying hundreds of thousands of domain names at once, many companies also use automated systems which buy up thousands of variations on names, as well as all of them as .com, .info, .net and more.</p>
<p>The Trump Organization does not appear to have done either: a smaller, directed set of names can be traced back directly to its general counsel.</p>
<p>“It could be because the company’s thinking about moving in a particular direction and it wants to make sure it had had the domain name space to expand,” Goldman said, “or it can be to pre-empt a squatter, to avoid something else taking the domain name.”</p>
<p>Some of the registration renewals are perplexing. The president’s company renewed 79 site name variations of Trump University first registered 2007-2009, from TrumpUHartford.com, TrumpUniversityTN.com to TrumpUniversityWealthBuilding.com, though Trump University had officially been shuttered in 2010 and was by last summer deep in the lawsuit that ultimately led to the president’s decision to settle for $25 million after being elected.</p>

<div id="foreign"></div>
<p>Trump’s company also renewed 59 other site names to potentially extend the Mar-a-Lago brand beyond Palm Beach, most first registered in 2012, from Chicago to Las Vegas to Panama and Toronto.</p>
<p>Since Trump’s election, membership fees have doubled to $200,000 annually at the original in Florida, where the president flew on Air Force One nearly every weekend during the early months of his presidency, often popping in to functions held there.</p>
<p>According to his personal financial disclosure filed this month, since he became president, Trump’s profits have spiked by millions of dollars at Mar-a-Lago and the Bedminster, N.J. golf course where he is spending most of his weekends in recent months.</p>
<p>Other sites renewed by the Trump Organization appear to reflect plans to leverage the personality that Trump marketed into a shocking self-propelled White House run, including LiveLikeATrump.com, LiveTheTrumpLife.com and ThinkLikeATrump.com, or for those looking for more permanence, TrumpInk.com and TrumpTats.com. Alternatively, people might have been able sign up for DownloadTheDonald.com, a site registered despite the president’s dislike of that New York tabloid-born nickname.</p>
<p>Then there are site names which, though registered in the same way as the others, may be defensive domain squatting to keep others from starting troublemaking websites, like TrumpNetworkPonziScheme.com, DonaldTrumpPyramidScheme.com, TrumpIsFired.com and TrumpVodkaSucks.com–the last registered all the way back in December 2005.</p>
<p>Old political sites like TrumpIsHired2012.com (registered Jan. 24, 2011) and DonaldTrump2012.com (registered Sept. 15, 2010) have been annually renewed, while new ones have popped up, including Trump2016.com (registered Sept. 2, 2014) and MakeAmericaGreatAgain.us (registered March 26, 2015)—both months before he launched his campaign. There are many in the names of Trump’s children and grandchildren as well.</p>
<p>But a large chunk of the domain names registered by the Trump Organization over roughly the last five-and-a-half years are more than 900 that point the way to potential foreign ventures. Many relate to known projects, like his golf course in Scotland and his apartment development in Mumbai.</p>
